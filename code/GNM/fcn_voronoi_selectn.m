function xnew = fcn_voronoi_selectn(x,fval,ndraw,bounds,pow)
% preferentially sample parameter values using voronoi tessellation
%
% Inputs:
%
%   x = [P x n] set of n parameter values
%
%   fval = [P x 1] set of objective function (we treat small values as 
%       indicative of "better" parameters).
%
%   ndraw = number of new samples you want to generate.
%
%   bounds = [P x 2] range of parameters (the bounds in which any 
%       interesting behavior will occur -- can be really broad).
%       bounds(:,1) is the lower limit and bounds(:,2) is the upper limit
%
%   pow = the "alpha" exponent from the paper. If this value is big, then
%       your new samples will be drawn from only the best regions of
%       parameter space. Smaller values will still preferentially sample
%       from good regions of parameter space, but may include some
%       not-so-great samples, as well.
%
% Outputs:
%
%   xnew = [ndraw x n] set of parameters.
%

% be huge differences of scale
